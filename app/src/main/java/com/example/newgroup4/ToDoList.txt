errors:

1/// (---SOLVED---)
cannot login, app crashes immediately. Suspected that database is not setup correctly.
error code is 503: service unavailable.

to do:
- check if database is setup correctly
    (in "setup API", Tick Auth button)
    (run the required commands in the sql text input)
- check if database is connected correctly
- create proper error message handling

p/s: login works using the old database, but is unable to connect with new one.
